# PasswordGenerator
Rudimentary password generator in C++ that outputs a randomly generated password based on user defined length. 
- Input validation to ensure user enters whole numbers or Y/N only
- Unique "back to back" generation to ensure the same character isn't generated consecutively in any two characters
- Option to repeat password generation for as long as user requires
